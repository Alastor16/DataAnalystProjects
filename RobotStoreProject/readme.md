## Data Overview and Cleaning

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - The dataset contains restaurant data with categories like `address`, `type`, and `number of seats`.
   - A small number of null values were observed in the chain column; these were removed to maintain data quality.

2. **Data Distribution:**
   - The majority of entries are categorized as "restaurants," while other categories such as "fast food" and "coffee" are underrepresented.
   - This imbalance may indicate a sampling bias, which could be addressed with better subdivision of restaurant types.

## Key Insights

- **Street Analysis:**
  - Sunset Boulevard has the highest concentration of restaurants, followed by Pico Boulevard.
  - This indicates these streets are potential hotspots for restaurant investments.

- **Chain vs. Independent:**
  - Most of the dataset represents non-chain restaurants, suggesting an opportunity for chain expansions or investments.
