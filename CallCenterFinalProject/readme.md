##overview
This project is based on analyzing a data base from a callcenter. Target of the analysis: the callcenter owners and managers. Objective: We want to learn which operators have a low performance. Delivery: an analysis of low performers, with an extension on how to define them and any information relevant to the case.
The dataset has the information on the client that made the call, the operator that answered (identified by their operator_id) and other relevant data such as if the called was amissed call, the duration of the calls, and the wait times.
Based on the objective we need to find the operators that have a low performance. For that part we need to define how we are measuring performance, what is the values that we are taking into account, and what are the thresholds for them. Then we can create a tag of high performer vs low performer. Once we have a dataset of low performer and high performers we can start to compare them so we can see if there is any pattern present in the low performers, or the high performers. Afterwards we will formulate hypothesis based on those patterns, and test them. The hypothesis must be tested because there can be false associations between the data and we want to pinpoint the reasons for the low performers.
